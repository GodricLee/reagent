The model will always respond with an &ldquo;Assistant&rdquo; section.\n\nEven if you are not building a chatbot, you can use the chat format to delineate &rdquo;turns&ldquo; taken by the system. &ldquo;User&rdquo; sections do not need to be formatted as natural-language questions.\n\nMany of the highest-quality large language models are available only in chat format, so it can be valuable to use chat prompts even if your prompt only ever consists of a single &ldquo;User&rdquo; turn."
